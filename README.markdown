## Blog license

Octopress and its default theme are under the MIT license.

I ask that you don't base your blog's design on mine, or use the distinctive custom year scrolling, since I like my blog to have an identity of its own. The default theme is great, though, and a good place to start on yours.

The pug graphic is under copyright, as are blog post contents; code is under MIT unless otherwise stated.
