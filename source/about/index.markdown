I’m [Henrik Nyh](http://henrik.nyh.se). I was born in 1983 and I live in Stockholm, Sweden with [Johanna](http://johannaost.com).

You can reach me at [@henrik](http://twitter.com/henrik) or <henrik@nyh.se>.

See my [gists](https://gist.github.com/henrik) and my [GitHub](http://github.com/henrik).

I work at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se/), doing mostly full-stack Ruby on Rails.

I have a master’s degree in computational linguistics, though I’ve found I enjoy computers and linguistics more when they’re separate.

I like reading, running, the gym, travel, cooking, baking, photography and pugs, but my main passion is web development. I'm particularly into flows, user interfaces and delightful touches.
